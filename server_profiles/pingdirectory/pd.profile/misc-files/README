This profile was created with the manage-profile generate-profile subcommand.
It was generated at 18/Jun/2019:17:52:18.878 +0000 by user root, from the
server in /opt/server.

Certain steps will always need to be taken to use this generated profile with
the manage-profile tool. The generated profile includes a setup-arguments.txt
file that contains variables, such as ${PING_INSTANCE_NAME}. When using this
profile with the manage-profile tool, values for those variables will need to
be provided using either a profile variables file or environment variables. See
manage-profile setup --help for more information on providing variable values.
In addition, the generated profile does not include any LDIF files. Any desired
LDIF data for the profile will need to be added to the correct backend's
directory under the ldif/ directory (such as ldif/userRoot/ for the userRoot
backend). File-based arguments in setup-arguments.txt, such as
--rootUserPasswordFile, must have the necessary files available when the
profile is run. The provided PING_PROFILE_ROOT and PING_SERVER_ROOT variables
can be used when referring to those files.

Other steps may need to be taken depending on the generated profile. Additional
files can be added to the generated profile, such as server root files, server
SDK extensions, and dsconfig commands. The profile can be modified as necessary
for documentation and organization.

For more information on the server profile, see the example profile template
and README in resource/server-profile-template.zip in the server root.
