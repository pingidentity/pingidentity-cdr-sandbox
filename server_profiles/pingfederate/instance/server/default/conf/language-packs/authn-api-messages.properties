# This file specifies the message strings for errors defined in the PingFederate
# Authentication API SDK.

# This file is placed in the server/default/conf/language-packs directory of your
# PingFederate installation. Your installation likely already includes a version 
# of this file. When installing an adapter that includes this file, keep the
# later of the two versions. Refer to the file timestamp above to determine
# which version is later. 

# If message content has already been customized, then a simple replace of the
# existing file may not be desired. Instead, keys added in the more recent file
# will need to be manually copied, and possibly customized and/or localized.
