The server renders this JSON content to an OAuth client when
an OAuth rule denies a request.

Velocity variables (identified by the $ character) are generated
at runtime by the server.

Change text or formatting as needed. Modifying Velocity statements
is not recommended as it may interfere with expected server behavior.

The following variables are available for use in this template:
    $trackingId     - a unique identifier for the OAuth token, correlatable with PingFederate audit logs
    $title          - a title for the content suitable for inclusion in the HTML <title> tag
    $header         - a more specific title suitable for inclusion in body content
    $info           - the specific reason for the policy denial - should be encoded with $Encode.forJavaScriptSource($info)
    $exchangeId     - a unique identifier for the request/response pair processed by PingAccess
    $Encode         - an org.owasp.encoder.Encode class suitable for html encoding strings
    $locale         - a java.util.Locale representing the resolved localization
    $localizedMessageResolver - a com.pingidentity.pa.sdk.localization.LocalizedMessageResolver
    $applicationId   - a unique identifier for the application requested if applicable
    $applicationName - the name of the application requested if applicable

Custom localized messages defined in pa-messages.properties can be added to this template by using the
$localizedMessageResolver.  For example, if a custom property named 'my.custom.message' was added to pa-messages.properties
and any other locale specific properties files, the localized value can be added to this template with the following:

    $Encode.forHtml($localizedMessageResolver.resolveMessage($locale, "my.custom.message"))
